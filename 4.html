		<li><ul><h1>1- quality of connectivity- as one of the disadvantages, mobile devices will need either WiFi connectivity or mobile network connectivity such as GPRS, 3G and in some countries even 4G connectivity  that is why this is a disadvantage because if you are not near any of these connections your access to the internet is very limited.</h1>
			
		</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>2- security concerns- Mobile VPNs are unsafe to connect to, and also syncing devices might also lead to security concerns. accessing a WiFi network can also be risky because WPA and WEP security can be bypassed easily.</h1>
			
		</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>3- Power Consumption- due to the use of batteries in these devices, these do not tend to last long, if in a situation where there is  no source of power for charging then that will certainly be a let down.</h1>
